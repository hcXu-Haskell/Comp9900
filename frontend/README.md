## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
yarn

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## User Site

[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

User site is the main part of the application.

## Admin site

[http://localhost:3000/admin](http://localhost:3000/admin)

As we didn't have another application for admin dashboard, we designated route `/admin` to it. You can manually type in the url http://localhost:3000/admin or click the link above.
